# Push APIs

Cultivate Forecasts provides push-based APIs for [question](#questions) creation, update, resolution, and [clarification](#clarifications).

For each of these APIs, Cultivate Forecasts will make an HTTP POST request to a URL that you specify. The body of the request will contain JSON matching that from the API documentation for each of those models (e.g. a question creation post-hook will contain the question JSON shown [here](#questions)).

To set up a post-hook for any of these APIs, contact Cultivate Labs' technical support team: [tech@cultivatelabs.com](mailto:tech@cultivatelabs.com)
