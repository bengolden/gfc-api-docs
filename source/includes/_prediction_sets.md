# Prediction Sets

A prediction set is the primary model for storing forecasts within Cultivate Forecasts. A prediction set can contain a single prediction or multiple predictions, depending on the question type. In a prediction market, all prediction sets have a single prediction (a trade). In an opinion pool, prediction sets have one prediction for each answer in the question.

## Prediction Set Creation

All predictions are part of a prediction set. In the case of a prediction market, the prediction set will have a single prediction (aka. a trade), while an opinion pool question will have multiple predictions as part of a single prediction set (one for each answer in the question).

This endpoint can be used to submit new prediction sets. All prediction sets require a question id as part of the URL and must include parameters for the prediction set. See below for a list of required parameters. All parameters must be nested under a "prediction_set" key (see example request body below).
